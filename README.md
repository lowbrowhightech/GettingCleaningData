# README for run_analysis.R

This script uses data from the Human Activity Recognition Via Smartphones Dataset.  This dataset contains data collected from volunteers who wore the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone while performing various activities.  Data was collected from the the accelerometers within the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

This singular script takes various steps to manipulate the data, but ultimately creates a summary data frame showing each participant's average outcomes for his or her standard deviation and mean readings. The steps that the script performs are:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Comments within the script identify each of these steps.
